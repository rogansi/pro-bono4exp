<div class = "tellMe">
	<p>Thank you for visiting my home on the web!  My name is Heather Walling and I am an artist living in Minnesota.  I have been working in design for the past 5 years, and have a local studio located (some location), where a number of my pieces can be seen on display.
    </p>
	<p>So have a look around, check me out on Facebook, Twitter, Pintrist, or send me an email with any questions.  I look forward to hearing from you if you like what you see.</p>
